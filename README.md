== About ==

This project is nothing more than my personal translation space where I work on French translations of a few selected WordPress Codex articles.

Yes, I know -- the normal workflow would require me to store the temporary translations in my wiki user space. But the problem with this is: I mostly work on those translations when I am offline. The method that works best for me is a text file stored locally on my drive, in sync with DropBox -- and this GitHub repository.

Once a translation is usable, it will be uploaded to the Codex.
